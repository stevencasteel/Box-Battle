# src/core/events/event_catalog.gd
## A central, canonical list of all event names in the project.
##
## By using these constants instead of raw strings (e.g., [code]EventBus.emit(EventCatalog.PLAYER_DIED)[/code]),
## we gain IDE autocompletion and prevent typos that lead to silent runtime failures.
